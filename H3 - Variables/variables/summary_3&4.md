In this chapter I learned some stuff about variables.

- veriables are created using the let key-woord
- creating a veriable with just the let key-word will make them immutable. (immutable variables should be written in all caps)
- The mut key-word will make the variable mutable
- by recreating a variable (with let) you overwrite/shadow the variable.
- by recreating/shadowing a variable you can change its type.
- a let mut variable cannot change type.

Datatypes
- a signed number is a number with a minus or positive sign before it. if a number is unsigned it will alsays be apositvie number. this is only valid for integers
- there are 4 scalar types:integers,.floating-points, Booleans and characters.
- numbers can have underscores as seperators. example: 99_222 = 99222
- floating points have two forms, f32, f64. default version is f64.
- characters use single quotes. charactars represent a unicose scalar value. Unicode Scalar Values range from U+0000 to U+D7FF and U+E000 to U+10FFFF inclusive.

Compound types can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

- Tuples can be accesed by using a (.) operator. 
- use brackets to make a tubple. ()

- arrays are made using square braces []
- arrays are accesed using the square brackets [0]
