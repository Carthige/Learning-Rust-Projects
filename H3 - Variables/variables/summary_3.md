In this chapter I learned some stuff about variables.

- veriables are created using the let key-woord
- creating a veriable with just the let key-word will make them immutable. (immutable variables should be written in all caps)
- The mut key-word will make the variable mutable
- by recreating a variable (with let) you overwrite/shadow the variable.
- by recreating/shadowing a variable you can change its type.
- a let mut variable cannot change type.
