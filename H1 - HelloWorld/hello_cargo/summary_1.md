In this chaper we learned that there are 
different cargo commands:


- cargo --version:
    Tels you the version of cargo you are using
    
- cargo new project_name --bin :
    This command will create a folder for your new project 
    and prepare it to produce binaries

- cargo build:
    Builds your cargo project 
    This function checks your code and produces 
    A binary/executeble

- cargo run:
    Runs your project after it compiled your code

- cargo check:
    Only checks your code for errors and makes sure
    It compiles. But does not create an executable
